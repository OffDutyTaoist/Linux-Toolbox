Toolbox Guide: Lock DNS to Cloudflare and Sanitize Wi-Fi on Linux Mint (NetworkManager)
Objective:
Lock system DNS to Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1 and IPv6 equivalents).

Remove all non-trusted Wi-Fi profiles.

Connect only to your trusted network (Your Network).

Ensure NordVPN uses Cloudflare DNS for secure tunneling.

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Remove Untrusted Wi-Fi Connections
List saved connections:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmcli connection show
Then delete everything except the trusted one:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nmcli connection delete "Untrusted Network 1"
sudo nmcli connection delete "Untrusted Network 2"
# etc...
2. Connect to Your Trusted Wi-Fi
Scan for available networks:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmcli device wifi list
Connect:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmcli device wifi connect "Your Network" password 'YourSecurePassword'
3. Force Static DNS (Cloudflare)
Prevent your network from using auto-assigned DNS:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nmcli connection modify "Your Network" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "Your Network" ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"
Enable IPv6 DNS override too (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nmcli connection modify "Your Network" ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "Your Network" ipv6.dns "2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001"
Apply the changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmcli connection down "Your Network"
nmcli connection up "Your Network"
4. Configure NordVPN DNS
Set NordVPN to use Cloudflare DNS as well:

bash
Copy
Edit
nordvpn set dns 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
nordvpn connect usXXXX  # Replace with your preferred NordVPN server
5. Confirm DNS is Set Correctly
Check DNS settings:

bash
Copy
Edit
resolvectl status
Look for:

Global DNS → 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

Wi-Fi Interface (e.g., wlp5s0) → Cloudflare DNS only

NordVPN Interface (e.g., nordlynx) → Also using Cloudflare

Notes:
Replace "Your Network" and 'YourSecurePassword' with your actual values.

This process clears old connections and enforces DNS privacy, preventing leakage.

You can rerun this guide after a reinstall, network reset, or if you suspect DNS hijacking.
