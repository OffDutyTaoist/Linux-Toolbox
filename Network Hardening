# 🛡️ Toolbox Guide: Lock DNS to Cloudflare and Sanitize Wi-Fi on Linux Mint (NetworkManager)

## 🎯 Objective:
- Lock system DNS to Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`, `2606:4700:4700::1111`, `2606:4700:4700::1001`)
- Remove all non-trusted Wi-Fi profiles
- Connect only to your trusted network (`YourNetwork`)
- Ensure NordVPN uses Cloudflare DNS for secure tunneling

---

## STEP 1: Remove Untrusted Wi-Fi Connections

**List saved connections:**

nmcli connection show

# Delete everything except your trusted network:

sudo nmcli connection delete "Untrusted Network 1"
sudo nmcli connection delete "Untrusted Network 2"

# Repeat for others if needed

## STEP 2: Connect to Trusted Wi-Fi

# Scan for networks:

nmcli device wifi list

# Connect:

nmcli device wifi connect "YourNetwork" password 'YourSecurePassword'

## STEP 3: Force Static DNS (Cloudflare)

# Override auto-assigned DNS:

sudo nmcli connection modify "YourNetwork" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "YourNetwork" ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"

# (Recommended) Add IPv6 override:

sudo nmcli connection modify "YourNetwork" ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "YourNetwork" ipv6.dns "2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001"

# Apply the changes:

nmcli connection down "YourNetwork"
nmcli connection up "YourNetwork"

## STEP 4: Configure NordVPN DNS

# Lock NordVPN to Cloudflare DNS:

nordvpn set dns 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
nordvpn connect usXXXX  # Replace 'usXXXX' with your preferred server

## STEP 5: Confirm DNS Is Set Correctly

# Check active DNS config:

resolvectl status

# Look for:

Global DNS: → 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

Wi-Fi Interface: → Should only show Cloudflare DNS

NordVPN Interface: (e.g., nordlynx) → Should also reflect Cloudflare

## BONUS: Quick Restore Script
Paste this into a .sh file (e.g., wifi-relock.sh), make it executable with chmod +x wifi-relock.sh, and run with sudo ./wifi-relock.sh.

#!/bin/bash

# Replace with your actual SSID and password

SSID="YourNetwork"
PASSWORD="YourSecurePassword"

# Delete all connections except your trusted one

for conn in $(nmcli connection show | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}' | grep -v "$SSID"); do
    sudo nmcli connection delete "$conn"
done

# Reconnect

nmcli device wifi connect "$SSID" password "$PASSWORD"

# Force DNS to Cloudflare

nmcli connection modify "$SSID" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
nmcli connection modify "$SSID" ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"
nmcli connection modify "$SSID" ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes
nmcli connection modify "$SSID" ipv6.dns "2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001"

# Apply changes

nmcli connection down "$SSID"
nmcli connection up "$SSID"

# Set NordVPN DNS

nordvpn set dns 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1

echo "Wi-Fi and DNS have been sanitized and locked to Cloudflare."

## Notes:
Replace "YourNetwork" and 'YourSecurePassword' with your actual values.

Run this guide any time after a reinstall, system compromise, or if DNS hijacking is suspected.

Always verify with resolvectl or dig to ensure DNS integrity.

Stay frosty, Ponyboy. 🔒✨
